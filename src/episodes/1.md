In this opening episode, we begin at the mythic heart of all textile creations, their philosophic nature and the thread itself. We unravel the story of Ariadne, the Cretan princess who offered a single thread to guide Theseus through the labyrinth — an ancient symbol of intuition, craft, individuation and survival.

From this timeless myth, we follow the thread through history and into the present day, where fibre becomes both material and metaphor in the hands of contemporary artists and makers and a therapeutic tool for self-reflection and mindfulness. This episode sets the stage for a podcast that sees fibre not only as craft but as a language of the soul, a map through the labyrinth of human experience and living.
